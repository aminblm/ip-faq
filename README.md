## What are all patentable subject matter?

Patentable subject matter generally includes the following categories, which cover a wide range of inventions:

1. **Processes**:
   - Methods or processes of doing something, such as manufacturing methods, business methods, or software algorithms.

2. **Machines**:
   - Devices or apparatuses that perform a specific function or task, such as engines, computers, or industrial equipment.

3. **Manufactures**:
   - Articles or products that are made, including everyday items like tools, utensils, or consumer goods.

4. **Compositions of Matter**:
   - Chemical compositions, including mixtures, compounds, and new chemical entities such as pharmaceuticals, polymers, or alloys.

5. **Improvements**:
   - New and useful improvements to existing processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter.

In some jurisdictions, additional categories or specific examples may be included under patentable subject matter. However, certain categories of inventions are typically excluded from patentability, including:

- Abstract ideas
- Natural phenomena
- Laws of nature
- Mathematical formulas
- Mere ideas or suggestions
- Artistic works (these are usually covered under copyright law)
- Methods of medical treatment (in some jurisdictions)

It's important to check the specific patent laws and regulations in the jurisdiction where patent protection is sought, as the scope of patentable subject matter can vary.

## Does industrial law design extend to digital designs ?

Yes, industrial design protection can extend to digital designs in many jurisdictions. Digital designs, such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs), icons, and other visual elements displayed on electronic devices, can often be protected under industrial design law if they meet the criteria of being novel and having an aesthetic aspect.

Here are a few key points about the protection of digital designs under industrial design law:

1. **Novelty and Originality**:
   - Like physical designs, digital designs must be new and original to be eligible for protection.

2. **Visual Appeal**:
   - The design must be primarily aesthetic in nature, focusing on the visual presentation rather than functional aspects.

3. **Registration**:
   - Digital designs can be registered with the appropriate IP office in many countries. The registration process usually involves submitting representations of the digital design.

4. **Scope of Protection**:
   - The protection covers the visual appearance of the digital design, preventing others from using a substantially similar design without permission.

Examples of digital designs that can be protected include:
- Graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
- Icons and buttons
- Screen layouts
- Animations and transitions

The specific requirements and scope of protection can vary depending on the jurisdiction, so it's important to consult the relevant IP laws and regulations in the country where protection is sought.
